            <h3>Loggerback Sea Turtle</h3>
                <p>One of the larger species of sea turtles, the loggerhead turtle ranges from 200-400 pounds (90 - 180 kg) and up to 4 feet in length (1.2 meters).<br><br>
                Primarily carnivorous and feed mostly on shellfish that live on the bottom of the ocean. They eat horseshoe crabs, clams, mussels, and other invertebrates. Their powerful jaw muscles help them to easily crush the shellfish.
                <br><br>
                Loggerheads are found in every ocean around the world in warm climates.
                <br><br>
                Listed as Vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h3>
                <p>Smaller sized than others, typically weigh 100-200 pounds(45-90kg) and are 2-3feet(.5 to 1m) in length.<br><br> Hawksbills have a narrow head and a bird like beak which allows them to get food from crevices in coral reefs. They like to eat sponges, anemones, squid and shrimp.<br><br> Hawksbill turtles reside usually in coastal reefs, rocky areas, estuaries and lagoons in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.<br><br>Many people consider this turtle to be the most beautiful because of their colorful spiky shells. Their beauty is their greatest enemy because people harvest them for their shells.<br><br>Critically Endangered.</p>

            <h3>Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle</h3>
            <p>Got their name from Richard Kemp, who discovered and studied the turtles. They are the smallest of all the sea turtles. Weight is around 70 to 108pounds(32-49kg) and size 2 feet(58-66cm).<br><br> Just like Olive Ridleys, they have powerful jaws and have a very similar diet of crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, fish, sea urchins, squid and jellyfish. Kemp's Ridley likes to live in shallow areas with sandy and muddy bottoms. They mostly only live in the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>
            Almost went extinct in the 1960s with only 200 nesting individuals. Now, thanks to strict protection laws, there's 7k - 9k of them today which still makes them Critically Endangered.</p>

            <h3>Green Sea Turtle</h3>
            <p>Is named so because their fat under the shell is green. Green sea turtles are the second largest after the leatherback turtles. They can weigh up to 500lb(225kg) and be four feet(1.2m) in length.<br><br> Green sea turtles are the only sea turtle that is strictly herbivorous as an adult. They eat sea grass, seaweeds, algae and other marine plants. When young, they eat worms, young crustaceans, aquatic insects, grasses and algae.<br><br> Can be found in sub-tropics and tropical sea areas worldwide, near coastline and around islands and live in bays and protected shores, especially in areas with seagrass beds. <br><br>Endangered.</p>

            <h3>Olive Ridley Sea Turtle</h3>
            <p>The name comes for its olive green colored shell. Are 77 to 100pounds(35-45kg) in width and 2 to 2.5 feet(62-70cm) in length which makes them the second smallest turtles.<br><br> They have powerful jaws. They like to eat shrip, crabs, mollusks, tunicates, fish.<br><br> Olive Ridley likes living in sub- and tropical water in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.<br><br> Vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>Leatherback Sea turtle</h3>
            <p>One of the largest and oldest reptiles and the largest sea turtles. Leatherbacks weigh around 660-1,100pounds(300-500kg) and are 4 to 6 feet(130-183cm). The biggest leatherback was almost 10 feet (305cm) and 2,019pounds(916kg).<br><br> The name comes from their shell which is composed of a layor of thin, though, rubbery skin, strengthened by thousands of tiny bone plates that makes it look "leathery". This also makes them unique because other turtles shells are covered with hard scales.<br><br> Because of their scissor like jaws, they feed almost exclusively on jellyfish. This makes floating plastic bags a big risk for them.<br><br> Leatherbacks have a wider habitat since they can tolerate lower temperatures (they can be found even in Alaska). They can dive deeper than 4,000 ft (roughly 1,200 m). <br><br>Listed as Vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>Flatback Sea Turtle</h3>
            <p>Unlike other sea turtles, Flatbacks have a flat shell. They are around 198pounds (90kg) and 3.25 feet(99cm) in size.<br><br> They eat sea cucumbers, jellyfish, mollusks, prawns and seaweed.<br><br> Flatbacks prefer living in turbid inshore waters, bays, coastal coral reefs and grassy shallows. Only found in the waters around Australia and Papua New Guinea in the Pacific.<br><br> Flatbacks are preyed upon by Saltwater crocodiles, the largest reptile on earth. <br><br>Vulnerable - data deficient which means not studied enough.</p>

            <p>There are multiple reasons why sea turtles are endangered. Human activity is by far the main reason why the turtle population is not doing so well.</p>

            <h3>Harvesting for Consumption</h3>
            <p>Sea Turtles are being overharvested for their meat, eggs and shells. Hunters wait for the turtles to come on land to lay their eggs, kill them and take their eggs.</p><br>


            <h3>Illegal trade</h3>
            <p>Some turtles shells are beautiful and colorful, which makes them desirable for making jewelry and  accessories. The biggest victims are Hawksbill and Green turtle. Scientists say that because of this, Hawksbill population has declined by 90% during the past 100 years.</p><br>


            <h3>Fishing</h3>
            <p>Each year thousands of turtles are accidentally caught by fishermen. Turtles swim in the same areas as fish do. They need to occasionally swim to the surface to get air but they can't do so when they're stuck on a hook or in a net. They can also get injuries from hooks and strangle themselves in the nets.</p><br>


            <h3>Marine Debris - Ingestion and Entanglement</h3>
            <p>Because we - humans, produce so much plastic and don't recycle it properly, other species suffer. Every year over 1 million marine animals die because of platic debris in the ocean. Many turtle species have jellyfish in thier diets. Jellyfish and plastic bags are like idenitcal twins. Leatherback turtles eat primarly jellyfish. Because of turtles downward facing spines, they can't cough the plastic out so it is stuck inside them until they die. Even if it's something small, it messes with their digestion. There's even a term called "bubble butt" which means the gasses get trapped because they cant digest normally anymore. The gasses cause the turtle to float, which leads to starvation and makes them an easy target for predators.</p><br>
    
            <h3>Natural Predators</h3>
            <p>Turtle eggs and hatchlings are an easy target for bigger and quicker animals. Raccoons and crabs raid turtle nests and even ants get their share from turtle eggs. After hatching from eggs, turtle babies get snatched up by birds. Estimated about 1000 to 10000 hatchlings survive into adulthood. As adults they don't have many predators other than occasional shark attack.</p><br>

            <h3>Artifical Lighting</h3>
            <p>Because of lighting from tourists, hotels, beach businesses and residences, females may prefer to nest in less optimal places or deposit their eggs in the ocean. Turtle hatchlings may become disoriented and wander inland. Scientists say that hatchlings instinct makes them go in the direction of light which is usually the moonlight on the sea.</p><br>

            <h3>Coastal Armoring</h3>
            <p>Beach properties often build armoring structures to prevent erosion. They prevent females reaching the upper proportion of the beach. This makes females again nest in less optimal places where nests are  in danger of waves.</p><br>

            <h3>Beach Erosion</h3>
            <p>Beach Erosion can be fought by nourishing beaches but it has to be done correctly. If the sand if too different from native sand or too smooth then the nesting place becomes unfitting and the sand can easily disappear and the nests fall apart with waves.</p><br> 

            <h3>Beach Activities</h3>
            <p>Human use of nesting beaches has a negative impact. Female turtes do not want any disturbances and will not nest or return to the ocean. They can even get trapped by beach furniture. Humans can accidentaly step on turtle hatchlings.</p><br> 

            <h3>Marine Pollution</h3>
            <p>Marine Pollution contaminates sea life. Plants can die and marine animals can get all sorts of diseases. 
            Oil spills and fertilizers are the worst pollutants.</p><br>

            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <p>A rise in sea level affects the beaches. Turtles return to the same beaches where they were born to lay their own eggs. Sand temperature affects the gender of a turtle.</p><br>
